# Introduction
This project provides Continuation/GMRES method (C/GMRES method), a fast computation algorithm of NMPC, and the C/GMRES method with multiple shooting.

# Requirement
- C++11
- Cmake
- Eigen 3

# Usage
Write equations of nmpc in nmpc_model.cpp and parameters in nmpc_model.hpp. In main.cpp, you have to set parameters for C/GMRES and set initial state and initial guess solution.
